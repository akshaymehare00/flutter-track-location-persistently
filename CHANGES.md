# Location Tracking Service Improvements

## Core Issues Addressed

1. **Duplicate locations on refresh** - Fixed issues with duplicate locations appearing when refreshing the app.
2. **Missing cards after app termination** - Ensured locations are properly saved and restored.
3. **Offline support** - Added ability to store locations locally when offline.
4. **API call frequency** - Standardized to every 10 seconds to reduce battery usage.
5. **Sync status visibility** - Improved visual indicators for sync status.
6. **Notification sounds removed** - Disabled notification sounds during location updates.
7. **Location deletion** - Added ability to delete individual locations, selected groups, or all locations.
